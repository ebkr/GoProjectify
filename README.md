## What is it?
GoProjectify is a Poftware Management Software, aiming to provide an easy way to list tasks and dependencies.

It can be used to break tasks down, or to create a chain of tasks to perform.

### Status

Functional! The only feature not yet implemented is the ability to rename nodes, however you can still delete a node, and create a new one to replace it.

The interface has been reworked a few times, and the quality of GoProjectify has improved.
