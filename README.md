## What is it?
GoProjectify is a Software Management Software, aiming to provide an easy way to create tasks and dependencies.

It can be used to break tasks down, or to create a chain of tasks to perform.

### Status

Not usable at the current time.

It can currently create a .projectify file, containing the required base information, with a certain name.

The project will primarily be back-end work, however upon completion, a front-end will be developed, allowing ease of use, and a tree-node display.
